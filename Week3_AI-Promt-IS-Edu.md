### Lab 12: (W8) Tell the AI: "You are the CEO of a company. Please argue both for and against the statement: 'IT can provide a sustainable competitive advantage for my company.'"
"""
As CEO, I see both sides:

**Argument For**: IT *can* provide a sustainable advantage when it is proprietary and deeply integrated with our unique processes. If we develop custom logistics software that cuts delivery times in half or a unique data model that predicts market trends, competitors cannot easily copy this. This creates a long-term, defensible edge.

**Argument Against**: In many cases, IT provides only a temporary advantage. Competitors can buy the same hardware or subscribe to the same SaaS platforms. Technology is often a commodity. True sustainable advantage comes from our culture, people, and how we uniquely leverage that technology, not from the IT itself.

"""
Lab 14: (W10) Tell the AI: "You are a project manager. Explain why 'Agile development' is better suited for rapidly changing market demands than the traditional 'Waterfall model.'"
"""
As a project manager, the traditional **'Waterfall model'** is rigid. We must finish one entire phase, like design, before starting the next. If market demands change mid-project, it's incredibly difficult and costly to go back. In contrast, **'Agile development'** works in short, iterative cycles called 'sprints'. This allows us to build, test, and get feedback on small parts of the product continuously. We can easily adapt our plan after each sprint, making Agile far superior for responding to rapidly changing markets.

"""
Lab 15: (W12) Tell the AI: "You are an economist. Analyze how the emerging skill of 'Prompt Engineering' will affect the digital divide between developed and developing countries."
"""
As an economist, 'Prompt Engineering' could have a dual effect on the digital divide. It might **widen the divide** by creating a new skill gap; nations that master communicating with AI will unlock greater productivity, leaving others behind. Conversely, it could **narrow the divide**. By lowering the technical barrier to using powerful AI, effective prompting empowers non-coders to create businesses, access information, and solve complex problems, potentially democratizing access to technology that was once exclusive. The outcome depends heavily on education policies.
