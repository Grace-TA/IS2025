### **1. 你最近使用的手機應用程式是什麼？它的硬體、軟體和資料核心組成部分是什麼？它為你解決了什麼問題？**
*(What's the last app you used on your phone? What are its core hardware, software, and data components? What problem does it solve for you?)*

**參考答案 (Sample Answer):**
My last used app was the **Gemini App**. 📱 The **hardware** component is my phone's processor and memory, which run the app. The **software** is the Gemini application itself, along with its underlying AI models and the operating system. The **data** includes all the text prompts I enter and the information the model generates in response. [cite_start]It solves the problem of needing to **effectively learn about anything I don't know** by providing quick, effective, and synthesized answers. 🤔💡⚙️

### **2. 想像你要為你最喜歡的咖啡店設計一個新的資訊系統。這個系統會如何幫助員工優化流程？主要使用者會是誰？**
*(Imagine you're creating a new information system for your favorite coffee shop. How would it help staff with their processes? Who would be the key users?)*

**參考答案 (Sample Answer):**
I would create a system that focuses on **workflow and pain points analysis**. ☕️ For example, it would track customer orders from the POS system to the barista, showing real-time updates on a screen to reduce mix-ups and wait times. It would also track inventory automatically, alerting managers when supplies like coffee beans or milk are low. The key **people** would be the baristas, cashiers, and store managers. 👨‍🍳👩‍💻📈🤝

### **3. 教材提到資訊系統能幫助組織獲得競爭優勢。你能想到哪家公司，它的資訊系統好到讓你覺得是它的「秘密武器」？這個系統有什麼特別之處？**
*(The material says IS helps organizations gain a competitive advantage. Can you think of a company with an IS so effective it seems like their "secret weapon"? What makes that system so special?)*

**參考答案 (Sample Answer):**
I think a company like **iGS (iGrowth Solutions)** uses an excellent IS. [cite_start]Their "secret weapon" is a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that is super useful. This system allows them to coordinate multiple AI experts—like the ones in their "STEAM" research team—to conduct deep research and provide structured, insightful solutions in real-time. This advanced IS capability gives them a significant competitive edge in the market. 🏆🤫🚀✨🌟

### **4. 你是資訊系統中的「人」這個角色。一個新系統在你的工作場所上線，但它讓你的工作更困難。你會怎麼做？你會如何表達你的擔憂？**
*(You're the "people" component of an IS. A new system is implemented at your workplace, and it makes your job harder. What would you do? How would you communicate your concerns?)*

**參考答案 (Sample Answer):**
It's important to **provide excellent use cases and playbooks to educate people** on how to use the new system. My first step would be to document the specific challenges I'm facing with concrete examples. Then, I would schedule a meeting with the IT team or my manager to present these use cases and pain points. Instead of just complaining, I'd suggest improvements and offer to help train others, turning a negative situation into a constructive collaboration. 🙋‍♂️🗣️📝💬❓

### **5. 你在日常生活中遇到的什麼問題，可以用一個簡單的資訊系統來解決？例如，管理你的日常行程或追蹤你的開銷。你提出的系統會如何運作？**
*(What's one everyday problem you have that could be solved by a simple IS? For example, managing your daily schedule or tracking your expenses. How would your proposed system work?)*

**參考答案 (Sample Answer):**
I think **LINE is a good tool for quick and simple communication with people**. I would use it as the foundation for a simple IS to manage group projects. The system would work by creating a dedicated chat group for each project. I would use features like shared to-do lists in the chat, the calendar for deadlines, and the notes function to store key documents. This simple IS would solve the problem of fragmented communication and document sharing that often occurs in team projects. 🤔🗓️💡✍️📊
